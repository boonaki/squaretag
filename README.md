The goal of this game is to tag the square! The square will be running away from your cursor.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

After sketching a wireframe of the project, I used basic JS to find each box, adding and removing functionality on click, depending on which click was first. I added a timeout to when the box will "run" to give the player a better chance at hitting the box. I was forced to play with the difficulty to ensure it was possile, yet still challenging

<!-- ## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->

## Lessons Learned:

During the process of building this project, I had originally failed to use any sort of OOP practices and thus my code was consequently very WET. It repeated itself at multiple points, but I was able to go back in and make the code more readible with better comments, more efficient by removing repeated lines and taking advantage of encapsulation and even including a HUD with a click count. 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples where I used similar practices.
